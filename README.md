# The Odin Project: Rock Paper Scissors

## Version 1

This is the first JavaScript project in T.O.P.'s Foundations course, in which the main task is to create the game **_Rock Paper Scissors_**. This game will be played entirely in the console, and assumes that user input is correct (although input is not case-sensitive).

## Version 2

Revisiting this project after learning about DOM manipulation, the main task of this version is to implement a user interface.

## Version 3

Enhancing the entire user experience by further updating the UI to be more attractive to user while maintaining an easy navigation.
